The code with the data can be found at https://github.com/maayank/cs7641assignment3
i.e. git clone https://github.com/maayank/cs7641assignment3.git

I implemented the code for the assignment using Python3 and heavy use of sklearn.
The requirements.txt file includes the versions I used - pip3 install -r requirements.txt should install them, as usual.
I've used Python 3.9.1.

The main entry point for my implementation is main.py. Running "python3 main.py" should run all the experiments and create all the png files used for the report.

As this repository includes all the needed data under data/, no further downloads are necessary.

Many thanks
